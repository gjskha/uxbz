PHP Fat-Free Framework URL-Shortening Demo

This demo should give you an idea of how easy it is to design and write an MVC-based application using Fat-Free. Please refer to the the source code and associated HTML templates for more information. The files contain a lot of inline documentation to help you understand how the application works and how the code interacts with the framework.

If you downloaded this file alone from SourceForge, you're missing the entire Fat-Free package. Head over to http://sourceforge.net/projects/fatfree/files/
to download the zip archive. The filename follows the format:-
